# DAT505-Jellyfish

My inspiration for this project is this video I took at the aquarium of some jellyfish in a tank (attatched in "Additional Files"). 
My main idea for this project is to create some kind of tank in the browser window with a few jellyfish that would 
either swim towards the mouse, or swim towards wherever the mouse clicks.
